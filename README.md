# Xray classifier Pneumonia detection COVID19
This project attempts to detect through the use of data and image analysis tools in the field of Machine Learning, such as convolutional neural networks or deep neural networks, the detection of COVID-19 SARS COV2 in chest X-ray images.

Through the use of neural networks in the field of Machine Learning, it is expected to have an accuracy greater than 85% in the detection of Pneumonia caused by COVID-19 SARS COV2.

The intention of this project is directed to the medical community to provide additional diagnostics in the detection of pneumonia caused by COVID-19 SARS COV2.

# Description
The user experience will be using a landing page in which you can load a lung radiography to review whether a person has COVID-19 or not.

# Data
It will be used to collect data from Kaggle data sets for the purpose of obtaining X-rays of people with positive COVID-19 cases along with images of normal lung infection, non-COVID and viral pneumonia.

# Ethics
The most important ethical implication is that this tool is supposed to be used as a support for COVID-19 diagnostic. It is not intended to be the primary source to define whether a patient has it or not. For this reason, the analysis has to be bigger with a COVID-19 test, symptoms review and medical record. Every hospital or doctor has to make sure the whole analysis is completed in order to diagnose a patient with COVID-19. 

# Platform
Mobile device and desktop using an internet browser. Also, Jupyter notebook for code review and step by step process.

# Libraries
```
imblearn
!pip install imblearn

imbalanced-learn is a python package offering a number of re-sampling techniques commonly used in datasets showing strong between-class imbalance. It is compatible with scikit-learn and is part of scikit-learn-contrib projects.
