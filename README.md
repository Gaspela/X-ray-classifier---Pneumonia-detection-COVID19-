# Xray classifier Pneumonia detection COVID19
This project attempts to detect through the use of data and image analysis tools in the field of Machine Learning, such as convolutional neural networks or deep neural networks, the detection of COVID-19 SARS COV2 in chest X-ray images.

Through the use of neural networks in the field of Machine Learning, it is expected to have an accuracy greater than 85% in the detection of Pneumonia caused by COVID-19 SARS COV2.

The intention of this project is directed to the medical community to provide additional diagnostics in the detection of pneumonia caused by COVID-19 SARS COV2.

# Description
The user experience will be using a landing page in which you can load a lung radiography to review whether a person has COVID-19 or not.

# Data

It will be used to collect data from Kaggle data sets for the purpose of obtaining X-rays of people with positive COVID-19 cases along with images of normal lung infection, non-COVID and viral pneumonia.

# Ethics
The most important ethical implication is that this tool is supposed to be used as a support for COVID-19 diagnostic. It is not intended to be the primary source to define whether a patient has it or not. For this reason, the analysis has to be bigger with a COVID-19 test, symptoms review and medical record. Every hospital or doctor has to make sure the whole analysis is completed in order to diagnose a patient with COVID-19. 

# Platform
Mobile device and desktop using an internet browser. Also, Jupyter notebook for code review and step by step process.

# Libraries
```
Imblearn
!pip install imblearn

imbalanced-learn is a python package offering a number of re-sampling techniques commonly used in datasets showing strong between-class imbalance. It is compatible with scikit-learn and is part of scikit-learn-contrib projects.
```
```
Pandas
!pip install pandas

pandas is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with structured (tabular, multidimensional, potentially heterogeneous) and time series data both easy and intuitive.
```
```
TensorFlow
!pip install tensorflow

TensorFlow is an open source software library for high performance numerical computation. Its flexible architecture allows easy deployment of computation across a variety of platforms (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs), and from desktops to clusters of servers to mobile and edge devices.
```
```
MatplotLib
!pip install matplotlib

Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
```
```
Numpy
!pip install numpy

Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.
```
```
Tqdm
!pip install tqdm

Smart progress meter, tqdm utiliza algoritmos inteligentes para predecir el tiempo restante y omitir pantallas de iteraci√≥n innecesarias.
```
```
scikit-learn
!pip install scikit-learn

ideal for using algorithms for classification, regression, grouping, and dimensionality reduction. Additionally, it features compatibility with other Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib.
